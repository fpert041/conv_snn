# Conv-SNN

Reimplemented in python by [@fpert041](https://github.com/fpert041) from previous work from [@AA-Samad](https://github.com/aa-samad/)

### Convolutional spiking neural networks (SNN) for spatio-temporal feature extraction
This repository is based on a [paper](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/event-data-classification-on-cifar10-dvs?p=convolutional-spiking-neural-networks-for) highlighting the potential of [Convolutional spiking neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12272) and introduces a new architecture to tackle training deep convolutional SNN problems.

## Prerequisites
The Following Setup is tested and it is working:
- Python>=3.5
- Pytorch>=0.4.1
- Cuda>=9.0
- opencv>=3.4.2

## Docker
- Set up the environment where all the programs can run
    + Run ```./run.sh```

## Data preparation
- Download CIFAR10-DVS dataset
    + Extract the dataset under DVS-CIFAR10/dvs-cifar10 folder
    + Use test_dvs.m in matlab to convert events into matrix of ```t, x, y, p``` (make sure to adjust the test_dvs.m folder addresses inside the code)
    + Run ```python3 dvscifar_dataloader.py``` to prepare the dataset (make sure to have files like dvs-cifar10/airplane/0.mat inside main.py directory)

## Training & Testing
- CIFAR10-DVS model
    + Run ```python3 main.py```


- Spatio-temporal feature extraction tests
    + For each architecture simply run main file with python3


- Note: There are problems with training SNNs, such as extreme importance of initialization; Therefore, you may not reach the highest accuracy as mentioned in the paper.
The solution is to try other torch versions and parameters or contact me / make an issue if you truly need the highest accuracy.
